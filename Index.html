	<ol>Welcome to my page! My name is Ben, and I am an organist at a few local churches. 
	I also am going to school right now for information technology. In 2014 I went to a school for Motuary Science because I work at a funeral home and wanted to further my career in that field. When I found that was not working 
out for me, I decided to make a career change and since I have always loved computers I wanted to give that field a try. That was when I found Tech Foundry, where I am hoping to further my career in an IT position. For more information, please
reference to my resume link on the top of the page.</ol>
